## 🛠️ Built for Performance

FlowSpace is built on a modern, "Indie Dev" optimized stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) with Tailwind CSS for a premium, fast UI.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance service logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase) for reliable, cloud-synced data.
- **Infrastructure**: Minimalist Docker configuration with Terraform (IaC) readiness.
